Sometimes you choose to keep your distance from someone, not because you don't care,
But because you know clearly that she doesn't belong to you.
Everyone I meet in life, the order of appearance is really important,
Many people will have different endings if they get to know each other at a different time.
Perhaps, some love, can only stop at the lips and teeth, hide in the years!
The biggest regret is not missing the best people,
It's when you meet a better person that you've run out of the best of yourself.
